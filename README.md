# Identity Tool

The **Identity Tool** is a simple web application that allows users to input their ID number and retrieve specific details, including their first name, last name, address, and a picture. This tool is part of the larger `pcpuppet.tech` website, but this README focuses specifically on the Identity Tool component.
